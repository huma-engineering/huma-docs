#### Information Security Policies

Huma employs thorough policies and procedures encompassing the security, availability, processing, integrity and confidentiality of all data. All policies are in line with ISO27001 requirements - 

- ISMS
- InfoSec policy & objectives
- Risk assessment and risk treatment 
- Statement of applicability
- Access control policy 
- Inventory of assets
- Business continuity procedures
- Monitoring logs (User activity, security events etc..)
- BYOD policy 

#### Human Resource Security

Each new employee must sign a confidentiality agreement and a BYOD policy. Based on their roles, training will be provided on specific aspects of security that they may require. After the initial on boarding process, employees will complete continual training involving information security, privacy, and compliance with company policy. Huma employs the following policies to ensure employees meet security standards - 

- Acceptable usage policy
- Bring Your Own Device policy
- Remote Workers policy

#### Asset Management

All employees and personnel must adhere to the IT asset control policy in order to protect the security of the network, protect data integrity and protect and control computer systems and organisational assets.

#### Access control

Huma’s access control operates on a least privilege basis, with user access being authorised according to business needs. Every user has a unique ID and password to gain access to Huma’s IT network an systems. The access control policy covers the following -

* Least privilege
* New User Access - Must receive induction training on the use of Huma’s network and IT systems
* Movers process - Access privileges shall be modified accordingly 
* Leavers process - Access to Huma’s systems will be withdrawn with immediate effect
* Seperated privileged accounts
* Privileged Identity management
* Central IAM strategy in place
* MFA 

#### Cryptography

Huma uses industry leading encryption technologies for all services and data. We encrypt our data at rest using AES 256 bit FIPS compliant encryption and in transit using TLS1.2 at a minimum

#### Physical and Environmental Security

Physical security is an important part of Huma’s security strategy, which is why we are committed to securing our facilities to the highest standard.

Huma has a security program that manages visitors, building entrances, CCTV and general office security. It is compulsory for all employees, visitors and contractors to sign in upon arrival and to wear identification badges which distinguish their respective roles.  

Huma’s Physical Security policy mentions the following - 
- Lost Access cards to be reported immediately
- Employees to challenge anyone that is now wearing appropriate visible identification
- Physical access capability to be reviewed quarterly
- Leavers must return all Huma property i.e access cards
- Employees must not allow unauthorised individuals to tailgate them when entering controlled areas  
- Visitor logs 

#### Operational Security

Huma understands that if best practice cyber security measures aren’t adhered to in production and development environments the consequences could have a severe effect on the business. 

Huma’s environments are broken up into four sections - Production, Demo, QA and development.  Separation of environments ensures we allow each to evolve in it’s own time, therefore mitigating the chances of cross contamination which in turn, helps protect sensitive data. 

Huma conducts penetration testing on every environment on the basis that, if a vulnerability were to be exposed in the demo environment this would also compromise the production environment. Below is a list of the practices implemented - 

- Redundancy
- Disaster recovery
- Access Control
- Minimalism
- Patching strategy
- Segregated networks
- Change management
- Auditing, logging and alerts

#### Communications Security

The security of Huma’s network and infrastructure is crucial to the day to day operations of the product. Huma separates it’s systems into different networks to better protect sensitive data from being compromised. Huma’s infrastructure is designed around the three core security principles - confidentiality, integrity and availability. The following is a brief summary of Huma’s full network security document -  

- Operational responsibility for networks separated from computer operations
- Special controls to safeguard the confidentiality, reliability and integrity of data
- Computer and network management activities will be closely co-ordinated
- Separation of internal networks from external networks 
- Cloud assets must have a defined owner
- High risk actions and changes in the production network must be logged

Huma’s services are built on public cloud platforms, these services were specifically chosen due to enhanced security and an outsourced model that allows focus on our products. 

#### System aquisition, development and maintenance

The Software development process outlines how software is built within Huma. We operate a secure development lifecycle with a 'shift left' approach to ensure that bugs and vulnerabilites are identified early in the process

#### Supplier relationships

Huma evaluates and qualifies third party systems/suppliers through the process of a security assurance tracker. This enables a high level of confidence in the provider and ensures we keep our commitment to Information security. After a new vendor is on boarded there will then be a periodic review of their security measures. The following are a few of the steps taken when reviewing a third party - 

- Security review in accordance to ISO27001
- Penetration testing and Vulnerability scanning
- Data Privacy and Security Related contractual reviews

#### Information Security Incident Management

Huma has established extensive policies and procedures for responding to  potential security incidents. A dedicated security team assesses any threats and security incidents to establish what actions need to be taken in order to mitigate any risk. 

A security log of any event that occurs is kept for the purpose of investigation - tracking and analysis of events and activities better prevents them happening again in the future. The incident response document outlines the following - 

- Detection and threat/risk analysis
- Event detection
- Containment strategy
- Mitigation
- Damage assessment and post mortem 

#### Business Continuity & DR

Huma’s procedures are regularly tested, reviewed and updated to ensure their effectiveness in the event of an emergency. Huma ensures critical systems such as production systems are kept safe by enabling high availability through multi availability zones (See availability), these include - Business data, systems, software, configurations and logs. These back ups are tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness.

- Snapshots are held in separate availability zones to ensure availability in the event of a location specific disaster. 

Huma maintains a Business Continuity plan which meets the following requirements - 
- Details specific roles and responsibilities in the event of an incident
- Improves Huma’s resilience in an emergency and enables business to operate as usual
- Provides a rehearsed method of restoring Huma’s ability to deliver and support it’s products and services
- Delivers a proven capability to manage a business disruption and prevent damage to Huma’s reputation, customers and services.
