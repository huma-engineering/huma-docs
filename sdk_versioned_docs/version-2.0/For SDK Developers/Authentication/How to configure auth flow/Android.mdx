## How to configure auth flow

In ideal case, the SDK should be able to handle the authentication flow without any additional
configuration. However, in some cases, you might want to configure in the authentication flow
manually.

### Configure auth types

Auth flow support two authentication types:

* Email
* Phone

To configure this auth types you need to set them in the ```SdkInitializer```:

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        authKit {
            configAuthTypes {
                email(buttonTextRes = R.string.email)
                phone(buttonTextRes = R.string.phone)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Configure manual Signup

This option allows you to enable or disable manual signup in the authentication flow. When set
to `true`, manual signup is enabled. When set to `false`, the signup process is handled
automatically by the SDK.

You can set this option in the `SdkInitializer`:

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        authKit {
            manualSignup = true
        }
    }
}
```

#### Retain Credentials

This option instructs the SDK to retain user credentials. This could be useful in cases where you
need to switch between accounts regularly, the user's credentials are saved for future logins. When
set to `true`, user credentials are retained. When set to `false`, user credentials are not retained
after logout.

You can set this option in the `SdkInitializer`:

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        authKit {
            retainCredentials = true
        }
    }
}
```

#### Manual Deployment Switch

This option allows manual switching of deployment environments. This could be useful in a
development or testing scenario where switching between different environments (like staging,
production, etc.) is required. When set to `true`, manual deployment switching is enabled. When set
to `false`, the deployment environment is handled automatically by the SDK.

You can set this option in the `SdkInitializer`:

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        authKit {
            manualDeploymentSwitch = true
        }
    }
}
```
