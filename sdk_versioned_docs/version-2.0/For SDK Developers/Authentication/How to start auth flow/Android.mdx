## How to start auth flow

To start the authentication flow, you need to register a callback in your activity or fragment. This
callback will be called when the authentication flow is completed. 

```kotlin
HumaAuthKitManager.getInstance().registerAuthResult(activity)
```

Then call the openAuthUI method to start the authentication flow.

```kotlin
HumaAuthKitManager.getInstance().openAuthUI { status: Boolean ->
    if (status) {
        // Authentication was successful
    } else {
        // Authentication failed
    }
}
```
