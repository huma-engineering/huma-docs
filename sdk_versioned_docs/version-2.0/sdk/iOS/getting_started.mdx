This guide will demonstrate how to integrate widget-based screens from Huma SDK into an existing iOS application. We'll use the CustomerAppSample, a sample weather app, as an example. The integration involves adding your SDK using CocoaPods, configuring the SDK within the AppDelegate, and adding a .plist file.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode installed on your machine
- CocoaPods installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Swift and iOS development
- A pre-existing iOS application (CustomerAppSample in this case)

## Step 1: Set Up CocoaPods

1. Open Terminal and navigate to your project directory:

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/CustomerAppSample
   ```

2. Initialize CocoaPods in your project (if not already initialized):

   ```sh
   pod init
   ```

3.	Open the generated _Podfile_, define the spec sources and add Huma dependencies in your _Podfile_:
   ```ruby
   source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
   source 'git@github.com:huma-engineering/huma-ios-specs.git'
   platform :ios, '16.0'

   target 'CustomerAppSample' do
     use_frameworks!

     # Pods for CustomerAppSample
     pod 'HumaAppKit'
     pod 'HumaHeaderWidget'
     pod 'HumaVitalWidget'
     pod 'HumaRealmPlugin' # in a short future, we will remove the need to add this pod

     # in a short future, we will remove the need to add post_install
     # currently, it's needed due to a 3rd-party dependency (FlagPhoneNumber)
     post_install do |installer|
        installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
            installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
                target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                    config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '15.0' # or your minimum deployment target
                end
            end
        end
     end
   end
   ```

4.	Install the pod:

   ```sh
   pod install
   ```

5.	Open the generated .xcworkspace file in Xcode:

   ```sh
   open CustomerAppSample.xcworkspace
   ```

## Step 2: Add the HumaEnvironment.plist File

1.	Download the _HumaEnvironment.plist_ file from the Builder portal and add it to your project's app folder.

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

1.	Open AppDelegate.swift in your project.
2.	Import your SDK at the top of the file:
    ```swift
    import UIKit
    import HumaFoundation
    import HumaAppKit
    ```
4.	Execute the SDK initialization method in the application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method:

    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        HumaApp.initialize()
        return true
    }
    ```
4. Add the log out handler:
    ```swift
    coordinator.onLogOut = { HumaApp.endUserSession() }
    ```

## Step 4: Integrate SDK Widget-Based Screens

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="push" label="Push" default>
1. Import the SDK:

```swift
import HumaAppKit
```

2. Declare a token property in your view controller class to store the returned reference.

```swift
var token: Any?
```

3. Add the method to push SDK screen:

```swift
token = HumaApp.pushWidgetScreen(withID: "ScreenID", into: navigationController!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="present" label="Present" default>
1. Import the SDK:

```swift
import HumaAppKit
```

2. Declare a token property in your view controller class to store the returned reference.

```swift
var token: Any?
```

3. Add the method to present SDK screen:

```swift
token = HumaApp.presentWidgetScreen(withID: "ScreenID", from: self)
```

4. You can also configure the presentation style:

```swift
token = HumaApp.presentWidgetScreen(withID: "ScreenID", from: self, config: .init(modalPresentationStyle: .fullScreen, showsCloseButton: true))
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tabbar" label="Tab Bar" default>

1. Open your main view controller that contains the Tab Bar Controller setup.
2. Import your SDK:

```swift
import HumaAppKit
```

3. Add the method to insert SDK screens:

```swift
class MainTabBarController: UITabBarController {
    var token: Any?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        insertSDKScreens()
    }

    func insertSDKScreens() {
        token = HumaApp.insertWidgetTabs(into: self)
    }
}
```
    
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Update Info.plist if needed

1.  Make sure that _NSCameraUsageDescription_ and _NSMotionUsageDescription_ keys are present in the Info.plist

## Step 6: Build and Run the App

1.	Select your target device or simulator in Xcode.
2.	Click the “Run” button or press Cmd + R.

Your CustomerAppSample should now include new widget-based screens from Huma SDK.

## Conclusion

You have successfully integrated widget-based screens from Huma SDK into an existing tab-based iOS application. For further customization and usage of the SDK, refer to the SDK’s official documentation.
