title: How to start Onboarding flow
---

Onboarding flow can be started by calling the `launchOnboardingFlow` method. This method will start
the onboarding flow. 

```kotlin
HumaOnboardingKitManager.launchOnboardingFlow(context) { status: Boolean, error: String? ->
    if (status) {
        // Onboarding flow finished successfully
    } else {
        // Onboarding flow failed to finish successfully
    }
}
```
