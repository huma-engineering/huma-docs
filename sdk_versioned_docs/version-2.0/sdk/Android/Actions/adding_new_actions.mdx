## How to create a Custom Actions

In Huma SDK, Actions are a way to interact with the user. They can be used to display information,
ask for user input, or perform an action.

To create new action, you need to create a new class that extends `KeyAction` class.
Or `BaseKeyAction` for generic look and feel.

```kotlin
class CustomAction : KeyAction() {
    override val uniqueKeyActionId: UniqueKeyActionId = "custom_action_id"
    override val keyActionId: String = "generic_custom_action_id"
    override val title: String = "Custom Action"
    override val startDateTime: Instant = Instant.now()
    override val endDateTime: Instant = Instant.now().plus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS)
    override val model: String = "Custom Action Model" //used for analytics
    override var completedDateTime: Instant? =
        null // set to null if not completed, or to the date when it was completed
    override var category: KeyActionCategory =
        KeyActionCategory.TO_DO // category of the action, used for sorting 

    @Composable
    fun keyActionCard(modifier: Modifier, showCompleted: Boolean) {
        // Composable function to display the action card
    }

    val order: Int get() = Int.MAX_VALUE

    val isLocal: Boolean get() = false //used in places in several flows that only require remote actions

    fun action(context: Context) {
        // Action to be performed, usually this is where you would navigate to an action screen
    }

}
```

## How to add the Custom Action to the Action List with the SDK

### Create a `KeyActionProvider`

To add the custom action to the action list, you need create `KeyActionProvider` and provide your
custom action through it.

```kotlin
class CustomActionProvider : KeyActionProvider {
    override suspend fun fetchKeyActions(datetimeRange: Pair<Instant, Instant>?): List<KeyAction> {
        // Fetch the custom actions from the server or local storage with optional datetime range
        return listOf(CustomAction())
    }

    suspend fun markKeyActionRead(keyAction: KeyAction): Boolean {
        // Mark the key action as read
        return true // return true if the action was marked as read, false otherwise
    }
}
```

### Register the `KeyActionProvider` in the initializer flow

To register the provider, you need to add your provider to the list of providers in the actionKit
initializer.

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        actionKit {
            providers = listOf(CustomActionProvider())
        }
    }
}
```

### _(Alternatively)_ Register the `KeyActionProvider` in the `HumaActionKitManager`

Then you need to register the provider in the `HumaActionKitManager` instance.

```kotlin
val humaActionKitManager = HumaActionKitManager.getInstance(context)
humaActionKitManager.registerKeyActionProvider(CustomActionProvider())
```

It is recommended to register the provider in the app startup, for example in the `Application`
class.

After that, the custom action will be displayed in the action list.

## How to add Custom Action to the Action List with the AppKit

If you are extending existing Huma Key Actions, you can use the `AppKit` to add your custom action

### Create a `ImportKeyActionProcessor`

To add the custom action to the action list, you need to create `ImportKeyActionProcessor`.

```kotlin
class CustomImportKeyActionProcessor : ImportKeyActionProcessor {
    override suspend fun processImportedKeyActions(
        keyActions: List<KeyAction>,
        context: Context,
    ): List<KeyAction> {

        override fun processConfig(keyActionConfigs: List<KeyActionConfig>): List<KeyAction> {
            // Process the key action configs and return the key actions
            return keyActionConfigs
                .filter { it.keyActionId == "custom_action_id" }
                .map { CustomAction(...) }
        }

        suspend fun markKeyActionRead(keyAction: KeyAction): Boolean {
            // Mark the key action as read
            return true // return true if the action was marked as read, false otherwise
        }
    }
}
```

It is recommended to use `BaseImportKeyActionProcessor` to avoid boilerplate code. Also it is
providing the markKeyActionRead method by default.

### Register the `ImportKeyActionProcessor` in the initializer flow

To register the processor, you need to add your processor to the list of processors in the `action`
block:

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    appkit {
        action {
            processors = listOf(CustomImportKeyActionProcessor())
        }
    }
}
```

### _(Alternatively)_ Register the `ImportKeyActionProcessor` in the `HumaActionsManager`

Then you need to register the processor in the `HumaActionsManager` instance.

```kotlin
val humaActionsManager = HumaActionsManager.getInstance()
humaActionsManager.registerImportProcessor(CustomImportKeyActionProcessor())
```

It is recommended to register the processor in the app startup, for example in the `Application`

After that, the custom action will be displayed in the action list.
