title: How to start generic Huma SDK flow
---

To start a generic Huma SDK flow, you need to call the `start` method on the `HumaAppKitManager`
instance.

```kotlin
val humaAppKitManager = HumaAppKitManager.getInstance(context)
humaAppKitManager.start(context)
```

> **Note:** Make sure to close all the activities that are not part of the Huma SDK flow before
> calling the `start` method.
