## How to authorise user in background

To authorise user in background you should override ```AuthenticationProvider```

```kotlin
class MyAuthenticationProvider : AuthenticationProvider {
    override suspend fun onTokenRequired(reason: Reason): AuthData? {
        // do a call to your backend to obtain huma session
    }
}
```

Where `AuthData` is a data class that contains the auth token and refresh token.

```kotlin
data class AuthData(
    val authToken: String,
    val refreshToken: String,
)
```

Then register this class in SDK initializer

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        authKit {
            authProvider(MyAuthenticationProvider())
            // or
            autoInitAuthProvider(MyAuthenticationProvider())
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Make sure to close all the activities that are not part of the Huma SDK flow before
> calling the `start` method.

If  `AuthenticationProvider` is registered with `autoInitAuthProvider` method, SDK will
automatically call `onTokenRequired` on the app start.

In on other case, when it's registered with `authProvider` method, you should do this call when your
are ready to authorise the user.

```kotlin
HumaAuthKitManager.getInstance().authorize()
```
