The settings section in the Huma Studio allows you to customise your app further. You can change the name, logo, language, default units, and legal documents. To make these edits, select the app you wish to modify, and navigate to the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Settings</span> page in the navigation menu.
