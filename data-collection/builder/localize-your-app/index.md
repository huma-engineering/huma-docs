title: Localize your app

Huma app builder has a **Hybrid** approach to localization and translation.

1. **Huma-managed texts**: Some texts, such as licensed questionnaires, static texts within the app, and more, are
   handled by Huma. Huma will take care of their translation.
2. **Widget-specific texts**: You are responsible for translating the texts you configure in your widgets via the
   localization section in the settings.

There are two ways to localize the widgets.

#### 1. Through the Huma Panel

- Any text you configure in your panel like the title and description here:

  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-builder-config.png>)
- Will appear in the localization settings of your app. Go to the settings and switch to the localization tab:

  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-settings.png>)
- Add a new language you want to add support for (Click "Create")

  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-new-lang.png>)
- Start translating, Then if your user has their selected language (OS language) set in the selected language they
  will see your localization instead:

  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-localize.png>)
- Once done click save, and preview the changes in the app.

Any missing localization will default to your **app default language**.

#### 2. Import/Export

You can import and export the localizations as well if needed, for example, to outsource the translation process.

- Click on the three dots of a language that is fully translated
  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-export-import.png>)

- Extract the file and you see this file structure so

  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-export-content.png>)

The content of the file would be something similar to this, You shouldn't change the keys, only the values
![alt text](<../assets/localization-export-file-content.png>)

:::info

The zip name is not important when uploading but the `lang` folder and file names are relevant so keep them
consistent. You should rename the file to other valid language codes, do the translation, and then import it to the
panel.

:::

- And once you are done with localization go ahead to import it, from the modal pick the language you want to be
  exported from the zip file
  ![alt text](<../assets/localization-import-dialogue.png>)

:::info

If a localization for that language already exists, the uploaded file will be merged to what is already there and
translate.
