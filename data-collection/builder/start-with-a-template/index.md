---

Huma Studio's templates streamline app creation from the start, regardless of the type of app you're building. Choose from a variety of pre-built templates that are easily customizable. Simply select a template and edit the existing components and app interface.
To get a head start on building your first app, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>App templates</span> in the Huma Studio's side panel.
2. Select the template that best suits your needs from the available options.
3. If you're creating a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) app, check the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>SaMD</span> checkbox.
4. Click the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Clone</span> button to begin editing the template.

You can also start with a blank template, providing a canvas for your creativity. Add tabs, widgets, and features to build a completely custom app.
<p>For detailed instructions on adding and customizing these elements, see "Step 2: Design the app interface" below.</p>

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent', border: '1px solid #297A7A', borderBottomWidth: '1px', borderRightWidth: '1px', padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '10px' }}>
