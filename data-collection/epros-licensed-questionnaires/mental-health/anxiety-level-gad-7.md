title: Anxiety Level - GAD-7
---

Anxiety is a feeling of unease that can be mild or severe and can have a significant impact on how a person navigates their daily life. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire screens for and measures the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). 

## How it works

The GAD-7 questionnaire is a quick and effective anxiety assessment tool for care teams. Patients respond to questions that ask how they have been feeling over the last 2 weeks, such as “How often have you had trouble relaxing?”. They answer from a set of multiple choice options that measure the scale of their anxiety:
- Not at all
- Several days
- More than half the days
- Nearly every day

To start, patients select the GAD-7 module and click "Add". When they have answered all the questions, they will be assigned a score that is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
