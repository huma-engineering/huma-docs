The signs and symptoms of Mental Health issues can vary depending on the specific issues, circumstances, and other factors. It can affect the day to day operation and function in general. Huma offers a range of questionnaires that Care Teams can receive self-reported answers from Patients. 

## How it works

The questionnaires ask subjective questions that help assess the Mental Health of the Patient in focused areas. Patients answer in a manner that expresses how they feel to prompts. That data is shared with Care Teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
