title: Pain

Pain is a personal experience of discomfort in any situation, but can be exacerbated by everyday activities. It can also be an indicator of other medical issues and affects individuals in their quality of life. Huma provides questionnaires for Patients to express the pain they are experiencing to Care Teams via the Huma app in the Clinician Portal.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask subjective questions that help assess the pain Patients are experiencing in focused areas. Patients answer in a manner that expresses how they feel to prompts. That data is shared with Care Teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
