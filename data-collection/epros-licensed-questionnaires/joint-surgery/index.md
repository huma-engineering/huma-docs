** Using Patients’ feedback for post joint surgery assessment **

Asking Patients post-surgery questions to assess the levels of success is a key part of their recovery path, helps with the decisions moving forward, and enables care teams to share insight back to their Patients. 

With joint surgery, patients answer PROMs specific to surgical outcomes related to joints. This is provided through the Huma app and viewable in the Clinician Portal, with domains such as Mobility, Function, Fatigue, Nausea, as well as others depending on which PROM the hospital or study decides to use. 

## How it works

Patients will be prompted in the Huma app that there is a questionnaire awaiting them, in some cases accompanied by a push notification. From selecting this to-do, questionnaires will have an intuitive flow taking the Patient through each question in several layouts such as a numeric score, multiple-choice, etc.

The results of which can be viewed in the Clinician Portal under the Patient’s detail screen alongside all other vitals and data.
