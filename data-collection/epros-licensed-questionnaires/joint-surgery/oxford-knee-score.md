title: Oxford Knee Score
---

Post-surgery care is key to successful recovery from any operation. The Oxford Knee Score questionnaire is a quick and effective way to ask the patient about function and pain after total knee replacement. Their feedback is shared with their care teams in order to provide the best post-surgery care.

## How it works

Patients are asked a series of multiple-choice questions about how they feel and are assigned a score out of 48, where a lower score represents a better knee function.

To start, patients select the Oxford Knee Score module and click "Add" to start. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
