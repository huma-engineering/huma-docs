Heart failure is a complex chronic condition that presents debilitating symptoms. Dealing with daily activities can be impeded and therefore Huma provides Questionnaires to assess how Patients manage their condition to Care Teams to work together in offering Healthcare. 

## How it works

The Questionnaires ask subjective questions that help assess Patients who have experienced Heart failure. Patients answer in a manner that expresses how they feel to prompts. That data is shared with Care Teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
