** Informing Care Teams with Patient feedback **

Feedback from Patients is a key part of being able to offer the healthcare needed by a Clinician. Huma, therefore, provides a feature to hold electronic and written questionnaires to deliver efficiently to the Healthcare Professionals to make informed decisions.

## How it works

In the platform, Huma provides the necessary tools to create patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) questionnaires and request for Patients to submit data against them via the app during the course of their remote care and study. Existing ePROs mentioned in the Knowledge Base can be toggled on for each deployment via Admin portal. In doing so, these ePROs would be available for patients to enter data against in the App and for clinicians to review the data on the web portal.

### ePROS

The licensed questionnaires that Huma pushes out in-app, are formed in a UX that will make the feedback easy to give, but extend the reach of people which can aid with the perspective of treatment overall. Clinicians can review the data submitted by patients on the portal following the patient's submission.
