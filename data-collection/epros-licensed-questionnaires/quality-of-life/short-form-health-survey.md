---

Assessing a Patient’s self-reported quality of life and functional health and well-being, can help evaluate their health status. Therefore, Huma provides the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) licensed PROM questionnaire to gather the perspective of the patient when it comes to their ability to fulfil daily functions. Working with Care Teams can help determine any actions that need to be taken and how conditions are managed. 

## How it works 

In this questionnaire, there are questions scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. There are 8 scores calculated following the submission of the questionnaire.
- Physical function
- Role functioning/physical
- Role functioning/emotional
- Energy/fatigue
- Emotional well being
- Social functioning 
- Pain
- General Health
