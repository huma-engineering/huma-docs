** Assessing the ability to operate in daily life **

Quality of life in health is the ability or lack thereof, to complete day to day tasks, such as walking, self-care, socialising, etc. Huma provides a collection of questionnaires to determine an individual's health on a regular basis. Tracking the Quality of Life allows Care Teams to work with Patients to evaluate both positive and negative aspects of daily life and make informed decisions.

These ePROs questionnaires are often utilised in Decentralized Clinical Trials, collecting outcomes from Participants after receiving treatment in the trial. 

## How it works

Questionnaires are presented as a collection of subjective questions that describe functional health in daily functions. That data is shared with Care Teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
