title: Patient Activation
---

Patient Activation is a way to assess how engaged a Patient is with their own health. This refers to the knowledge, skills and confidence to manage their well-being. 

Huma provides questionnaires to measure Patient Activation by asking simple questions about the Patients' self-care to share with their Care Team.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask subjective questions that help assess the Patient Activation of the Patient in focused areas. Patients answer in a manner that expresses how they feel to prompts. That data is shared with Care Teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
