**Organisation staff** -- any team member invited by an Admin or Access controller or a fellow Organisation staff, with a restricted access to the platform.

**Access controller** -- any team member invited as Access controller by an Admin or a fellow Access controller, with a restricted access to the platform.

### Inviting staff members

All staff members are allowed to invite other staff members, and are responsible for ensuring adherence to the User Agreement/T's and C's. To invite other staff members, head to your Profile dropdown, and select "Invite staff members". You can set their role from the invite modal.
