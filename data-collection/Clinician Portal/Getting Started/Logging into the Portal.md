# Logging into the Portal
**User**: All staff roles

Getting set up with an account in the Clinician Portal, whatever your role may be, works through invitations. Once a new deployment has been created on the Admin Portal, an invite will be sent out for an Administrator or Access Controller role.
These users, or any users on the Clinician Portal with permission to add other staff members, will be able to invite other users.
## How it works​
When you receive your invitation to join the Clinician Portal, you will be informed of your role in the email.

The email also contains a link where you can create your account. Click the **Create account** button and you will be asked to fill in your personal details, including your full name, email and password. 

The first time you log in, we will verify your details using 2-factor authentication; first verify your email by clicking the link emailed to you and then enter the 6 digit code sent to your mobile number via text message.

2-factor authentication will be used for subsequent logins but you can check the box **Remember me** to pause the mobile verification step for 2 weeks.
