# Calls and appointments
**User**: Patient

Patients sometimes need additional support from their clinician in the form of direct consultation. The Huma App facilitates this with the Telemedicine function which permits secure video and audio calls. Clinicians can [schedule an appointment](../../clinician-portal/telemedicine/scheduling-appointments.md) or [call their patient](../../clinician-portal/telemedicine/calling-patients.md) directly from the Telemedicine section of the Clinician Portal.

## How it works​

When someone from your care team schedules an appointment with you, you will receive a push notification and see a new task on the To do list. If you are happy with the time suggested, click **Accept** and it becomes a scheduled appointment. You will be contacted at the scheduled time. If the proposed schedule is not good for you, you can simply reject it. Your care team will be informed and will propose another schedule.

Your care team can also make unscheduled calls which you can choose to accept or reject directly. If you reject a call or miss it for some other reason, you will receive a missed call notification

Video calls take place in the Huma App without the need for any additional technology. The camera icon can be used to start and stop the camera and the microphone icon can be used to mute and unmute. The button with the arrow swaps between the front-facing and rear-facing camera. The red phone button ends the call.

Once the call has started, these buttons will disappear but can be brought back by tapping the screen.

You can find all your past and scheduled appointments in the **Appointments** section of your **Profile**. Missed calls will also be logged here.
