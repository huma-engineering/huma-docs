Huma provides quantifiable data and questionnaires from patients to inform and guide care teams in the healthcare they provide. However, sometimes a visual can be more helpful than data. The Photo module is a way for the patient to communicate certain information about symptoms, health status, medical history, diet, activity, etc.

## How it works

Patients upload photos to the Huma App or take them directly using the phone camera and add a note for their care team. They will also be able to access a history of previous photos uploaded.

In the Clinician Portal, care teams can view photos submitted by their patients.
