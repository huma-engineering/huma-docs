Huma provides quantifiable data and questionnaires from patients to inform and guide care teams in the healthcare they provide. However, sometimes a visual can be more helpful than data. The Photo module is a way for the patient to communicate certain information about symptoms, health status, medical history, diet, activity, etc.

## How it works

Patients upload photos to the Huma App or take them directly using the phone camera and add a note for their care team. They will also be able to access a history of previous photos uploaded.

In the Clinician Portal, care teams can view photos submitted by their patients.

By clicking on the module summary, clinicians can see when the photos were submitted, along with notes from the patient.
