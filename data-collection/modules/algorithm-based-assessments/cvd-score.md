---

The cardiovascular risk score asseses the risk of a patient developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the next 10 years and helps them make better choices that will improve their longevity. 

## How it works

Patients answer a series of questions relating to their lifestyle and the module also measures some vitals to calculate the final score.

This module helps patients to understand their health and to helps them make more informed decisions about their lifestyle. Data is visible only to them and is not shared with their care team.
