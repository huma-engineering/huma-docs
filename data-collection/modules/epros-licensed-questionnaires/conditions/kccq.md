## How it works

Patients answer questions about how living with a heart condition impacts their quality of life, both physical and social. The Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire has no right or wrong answers and takes around 4-6 minutes to complete.

From the KCCQ module, patients can start the questionnaire by clicking **Add**. They can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help keep patients on track.
