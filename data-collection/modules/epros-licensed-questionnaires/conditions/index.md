There a number of conditions which can affect a patient's daily life. Huma's conditions questionnares help to assess the impact the condition is having on the patient's daily actvities and the evolution of symptoms related to their condition.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask questions about how the patient can perform certain tasks and about the severity of symptoms related to the condition. Results are shared with care teams via the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and prioritise accordingly.
