title: Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (MG-ADL)
---

The myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) questionnaire is a quality-of-life PROM questionnaire where patients make a self-assessment about their current level of health. The questionnaire allows patients to use the Huma app to evaluate the impact of 8 key symptoms of myasthenia gravis on their daily life and share their responses with care teams in order to make more informed decisions about their healthcare.

## How it works

Patients are asked about 8 different symptoms of MG, including speech, swallowing, breathing, and eyelid droop. They are asked to rate the severity of each symptom from 0-3. The responses are converted into a score out of 24, with higher scores indicating a higher severity of symptoms.

To start, patients select the MG-ADL module and click **Add**. When they have answered all the questions, they will be assigned a score that is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. In addition, daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
