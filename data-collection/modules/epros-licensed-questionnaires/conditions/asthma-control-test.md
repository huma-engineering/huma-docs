title: Asthma Control Test (ACT)
---
The asthma control test is a questionnaire where patients answer 5 questions about their asthma symptoms over the previous 4 weeks to help their care team asses the severity of their condition.

## How it works

Patients answer questions about their asthma symptoms and their impact on daily life. Questions are scored on a scale from 1-5, giving them a total score out of 25, which is shared with care teams via the Clinician Portal.

To start, patients select the ACT module and click **Add**. When they have answered all the questions, they will be assigned a score that is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
