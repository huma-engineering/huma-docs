title: Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire (WHQ)
---

The Bluebelle wound healing questionnaire (WHQ) is a self-administered outcome tool to measure the efficacy of wound healing after surgery. 

## How it works 

The WHQ consists of a 41 questions about the condition of the wound. Some questions ask the patient to score their symptom on a severity scale while others ask for a simple yes/no response. An overall score is calculated by simply summing the scores for each item. When summed, possible overall scores range from 0 to 41 with a lower score representing a better wound healing outcome.

To start, patients select the WHQ module and click **Add**. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results.
