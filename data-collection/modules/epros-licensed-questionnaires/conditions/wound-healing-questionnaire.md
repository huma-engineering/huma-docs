title: Wound Healing Questionnaire (WHQ)
---

The Bluebelle wound healing questionnaire (WHQ) is a self-administered outcome tool to measure the efficacy of wound healing after surgery. 

The WHQ consists of a 41 questions about the condition of the wound. Some questions ask the patient to score their symptom on a severity scale while others ask for a simple yes/no response. An overall score is calculated by simply summing the scores for each item. When summed, possible overall scores range from 0 to 41 with a lower score representing a better wound healing outcome.

To start, patients select the WHQ module and click **Add**. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. 



In the Clinician Portal, care teams will see the latest WHQ score for their patient, with concerning scores flagged for attention.



In the Patient Summary, care teams can view all historical data in graph or table form.
