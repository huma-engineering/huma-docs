# Licensed Questionnaires

Questionnaires are used to collect feedback from patients so their care team are able to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROs/PROMs) are licensed and validated questionnaires that patients fill out to evaluate how they feel. Usually scored, they provide a useful indicator for their care team to measure the success in the treatment they are providing.
