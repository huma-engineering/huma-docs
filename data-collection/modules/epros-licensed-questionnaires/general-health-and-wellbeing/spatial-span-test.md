title: Spatial Span Test
---

The spatial span test is a cognitive test of a patient’s short-term memory. The test helps clinicians assess   short-term memory loss or cognitive decline.

## How it works

The spatial span test consists of a series of tasks where patients are shown a series of figures on the screen, with some of them lit up. Patients must remember which of the figures lit up and repeat the order they were shown. The tasks get more complex as the test progresses and will end when the patient fails two consecutive tasks and the score is calculated including the time spent.   

To start, patients select the Spatial Span Test module and click **Add**. They will be taken to an external platform to complete the test, then returned to the Huma App once they are finished.

From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results.
