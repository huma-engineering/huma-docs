title: General Health and Wellbeing
---

Health and Wellbeing are measured by a patient's ability to easily complete day to day tasks, such as walking, self-care, socialising, etc. Huma provides a collection of questionnaires to determine an individual's overall physical or mental health and how it impacts on their quality of life. 

These questionnaires are often used to collect outcomes from patients after receiving specific treatments. 

## How it works

Questionnaires are presented as a collection of subjective questions that assess levels of health in daily functions. That data is shared with care teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
