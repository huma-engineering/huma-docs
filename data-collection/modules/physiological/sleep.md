The sleep module helps to track different aspects of sleep such as sleep stages, length and how a patient feels about their sleep.

## How it works

This module syncs data from Fitbit. From the **Track** screen, open the Sleep module to automatically retrieve data from Fitbit and sync it with the Huma App.
