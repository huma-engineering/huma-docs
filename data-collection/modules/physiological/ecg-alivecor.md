title: ECG - AliveCor
---

An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart. The ECG module records the patient's heart rhythm and electrical activity to look for irregularities.

## How it works

The Huma App can record patient ECG data when synced to AliveCor devices. Patients log into their Kardia account from the ECG AliveCore module in the Huma App then choose the option "Sync device" and follow the steps to connect their Kardia account.

Patients can view their historic ECG results in a graph. In the Clinician Portal, care teams will be able to easily see the latest ECG AliveCor readings from their patients and any concerning readings will be flagged.

The Patient Summary displays a more detailed view of the patient's historic readings in graph or table form.
