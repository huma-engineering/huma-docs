** Taking a closer look at the heart. **

An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart. The ECG module records the data for a Patient's heart rhythm and electrical activity for the means of looking for irregularities.

This feature is available to iPhone Patients on iOS 14 or later, with Apple Watch Series 4 or later only.

## How it works

From within the module, Patients can view their progress in a graph and press “View previous entries” to view previous results in a table. Patients can also set a daily, weekly, or monthly reminder to help keep on track.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients, from which the ECG column will display the last recorded reading as one of the following results:

- Sinus rhythm
- Atrial fibrillation
- Inconclusive high heart rate
- Inconclusive low heart rate
- Undetermined

With that it will be indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.
