The Huma product enables Remote Patient Monitoring for many vitals that needs to be collected for Care Teams to advise and make decisions. The Physiological Modules record the data points that refer to the normal functions of the body, in conjunction with devices that are used to take measurements.

## How it works

From the Huma app, Patients can select a module, or be prompted from a push notification, and add their relevant data record. In some modules historic data can be viewed for personal review and Huma designs each module to display the most relevant information.

In the Clinician Portal, vitals can be viewed for a Patient so that Care Teams can prioritise, make decisions, and feedback any insight back to the Patient to improve their health care.
