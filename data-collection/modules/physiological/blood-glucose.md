** Monitor Blood Glucose **

For many people, regular blood glucose monitoring is an important part of managing conditions like Diabetes. In order to help Patients make a good decisions about their health, the Blood Glucose module will record results and be made available to their Care Teams.

## How it works

Patients will measure their blood glucose using a Blood Glucose Monitor, and enter into the Huma App. From there, Clinicians can view new and historic results in the Clinician Portal and be informed on severity.  

### Patients

From the home screen, Patients can select the Blood Glucose Modules, and simply by clicking “Add” a result can be entered in mmol/L (millimoles per litre) with the time and date automatically added as now, but editable.

From within the module, Patients can view their progress in a graph and press “Show all data” to view previous results in a table. Patients can also set a daily, weekly, or monthly reminder to help keep on track.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the Patient List, Clinicians can view a table of Patients, from which the Blood Glucose column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a Red Amber Green indicator to inform severity.
