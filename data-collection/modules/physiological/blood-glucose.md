** Helping diabetics manage their condition. **

For people who suffer from, or susceptible to, High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) are at risk of life-threatening complications and damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, kidneys and blood vessels. The Blood Glucose Module in Huma will record the values obtained via a Blood Glucose Monitor so Care Teams can assess whether you are in the normal range of 3.9-7.2 mmol/L.

## How it works

Patients will measure their blood glucose using a Blood Glucose Monitor, and enter into the Huma App. From there, Clinicians can view new and historic results in the Clinician Portal and be informed on severity.  

### Patients

From the home screen, Patients can select the Blood Glucose Modules, and simply by clicking “Add” a result can be entered in mmol/L (millimoles per litre) with the time and date automatically added as now, but editable.

From within the module, Patients can view their progress in a graph and press “Show all data” to view previous results in a table. Patients can also set a daily, weekly, or monthly reminder to help keep on track.

### Clinicians

In the Clinician Portal, on the [Patient List](/data-collection/features/navigation/portal/patient-list/)Clinicians can view a table of Patients, from which the Blood Glucose column will display the last recorded reading indicated as a [Red Amber Green](/data-collection/features/flags-and-rag/) indicator to inform severity.
