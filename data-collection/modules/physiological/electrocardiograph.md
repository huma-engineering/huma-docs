title: Electrocardiograph (ECG)
---

An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart. The ECG module records the patient's heart rhythm and electrical activity to look for irregularities.

## How it works

This feature is available to sync with ECG devices. Patients open the module and tap on **Sync** to retrieve the data from their device and sync it with the Huma App.
