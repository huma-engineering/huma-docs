title: Oxygen Saturation
---

The patient’s blood oxygen level measures the percentage of oxygen in the blood. The Oxygen Saturation module allows patients to monitor their blood oxygen level and share this data with care teams.

## How it works

Patients will measure their oxygen saturation using a pulse oximeter and enter the results into the Huma App.

The time and date is added automatically at the moment they make the entry (although this can be edited if needed) and patients will also be able to view all their historic blood oxygen results from within the module. Reminders can be set to help them stay on track and make sure they don't miss a reading.

In the Clinician Portal, care teams will be able to easily see the latest blood saturation readings from their patients in the SPO2 column and any concerning readings will be flagged.

The Patient Summary displays a more detailed view of the patient's historic readings in graph or table form.
