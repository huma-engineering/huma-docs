** Where data is collected from patients **

Each data category (e.g. Blood Glucose) is contained within a module. Some modules are a series of different data points (e.g. Body measurement) which collects different data points related to the category. Existing modules mentioned in the Knowledge Base can be toggled on for each deployment via the Admin portal.
