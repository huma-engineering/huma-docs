** Huma empowers Healthcare Institutions to build the experience and functionality they need, turning their Administrators into citizen developers. **

Each data category (e.g. Blood Glucose) is contained within a module. Some modules are a series of different data points (e.g. Body measurement) which collects different data points related to the category. Existing modules mentioned in the Knowledge Base can be toggled on for each deployment via Admin portal.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
