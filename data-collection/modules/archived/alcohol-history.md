title: Alcohol History
---

Over time, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to health concerns. The Alcohol History module aims to assess the risk to patients of developing health problems arising from excessive alcohol consumption.

## How it works

Patients answer a series of questions about how much alcohol they have consumed from various different categories. They will then be assigned a score to assess their current risk of over consumption.
