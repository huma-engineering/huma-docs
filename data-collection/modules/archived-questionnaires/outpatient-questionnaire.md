The Outpatient Questionnaire is a way of collecting information about hospital visits and sharing this information with care teams. 

## How it works

Patients will answer questions about the details of their hospital stay, including dates and the specialities they visited. 

In the Huma Portal, care teams will see the latest Outpatient Questionnaire responses from their patient. In the Patient Summary, care teams will be able to see all historical data in table form.
