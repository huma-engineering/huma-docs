title: Activity and Health Questionnaire
---

There are many reasons why being active and eating a healthy diet is important. As well as helping you to improve your overall health and well-being, it can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which can have other health benefits. Finally, being active and eating healthy can help improve your mental health and mood.

## How it works

Patients will answer questions in the Huma App about the activity taken and food consumed in the previous seven days. Care teams can view and track patient responses to the questionnaire in the Clinician Portal. Both patients and their care team will be able to view past reponses to track how their habits are changing.

In the Patient Summary, care teams can view all historical data displayed as a graph or a table of results.

The activity and health questionnaire has 19 multiple choice questions. The patient will have to compare the frequency of each activity with the previous week.
