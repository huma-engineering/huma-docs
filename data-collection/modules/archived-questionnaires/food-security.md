title: Food Security Questionnaire
---

Food security exists when people have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The Food Security Questionnaire assesses how participants feel about their access to food through the COVID-19 period and is part of the Fenland study.

## How it works

Patients will answer two simple questions about food security and their results will be stored and shared with their care team. 

In the Clinician Portal, care teams will see the latest score for their patients, with concerning scores flagged for attention. In the Patient Summary, care teams will be able to see all historical data in graph or table form.
