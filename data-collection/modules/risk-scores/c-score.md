** Understanding overall Health  **

C-Score is made up of metrics that are believed to be indicative of well-recognised and modifiable risk factors, and will be assessed digitally using a combination of patient-reported, active, and passive data gathering technologies.

C-Score includes measurements that indicate the many aspects of general health in order to be fully representative of overall health.
