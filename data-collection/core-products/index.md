**Huma provides digital-first care and research by creating a journey of data from Patients to Care Teams, and Participants in Clinical Trials.**

### Hospital at home

Our 'hospital at home' technology collects real-world patient data remotely. It connects patients and clinical teams, enables greater access to care from any location and improves efficiency for clinicians. This is achieved by lowering barriers for Patients to share the data with Care Teams that are needed to make better decisions about their health. 

### Generating data and insights in Life Sciences

Humaâ€™s digital first approach supports decentralized and hybrid clinical trials, which accelerates delivering effective treatments to patients as our DCT platform can improve trial participation, diversity, engagement and efficiency, at scale. This is accomplished by managing the data entered by Participants, Site team and Clinical Research Organisations, and throughout this journey will facilitate the recruitment, screening, consent, questionnaires and study closeout required.
