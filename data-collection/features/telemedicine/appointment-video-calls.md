title: Appointment video calls 
---

Patients being able to directly communicate with Care Teams are an essential part of delivering health care, and being face-to-face help provide a connection that is empathetic and attentive. Therefore Huma provides Appointment video calls to create that connection to gather the information needed from Patients and deliver insight and feedback.

## How it works

Care Team can schedule appointments from the Clinician Portal for a Patient, which will send a notification to their device with the date and time, and if they accept or decline that time.

### Clinicians

From the Clinician Portal, Care Teams can select a Patient from the Patient List and click on the phone to view the Telemedicine screen. Here clicking “Schedule an appointment” will prompt the users to add a date and time to enter an appointment.

When that time has reached the appointment the table will show a “Join Call” button and will start the call in the browser when clicked.

To enable calls, make sure your browser settings allow camera and microphone use.

### Patients

When an appointment is scheduled Patient will receive a notification to accept the date and time. Appointments can also be managed from the Huma App, in Profile and Appointments.

When a Clinician joins the call it will ring the Patients phone just like any other incoming call.
