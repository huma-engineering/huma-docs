** Helping Clinicians Contact their Patients. **

Huma endeavours to provide the communication methods needed to connect Patients to their Clinicians. One way we achieve this is by providing a means for a Clinician to call Patients to provide the information needed for their call, therefore a full video call experience is available on the platform. 

## Functionality
When a call on Huma does not complete, a reason is provided so that actions can be taken, e.g. try again, wait until later, attempt an alternative, etc. The options shown will be:

- Call declined
- No network detected
- No answer

To go with this a "missed call" notification will be presented to the Patient which will take them to the Book Appointment screen to complete the goals of communicated information that is needed.
