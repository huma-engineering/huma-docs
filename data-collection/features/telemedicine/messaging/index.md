** Using messaging to connect people for Care and Clinical Study **

Huma facilitates the connection between Patient and Clinician as well as Participant to Site Investigator. Therefore, basic communication is part of the core experience of the platform, and here Huma's built-in messaging platform becomes a powerful tool to connect people. 

## How it works

As Clinicians need to update and inform Patients, the one-way messaging system built into Huma will allow them to quickly send a message to convey positive affirmations, tips to help with progress, accountability, or something custom that a Clinician would see as appropriate
