Collecting Patient data and providing that to Care Teams is what Huma delivers with the Huma App and Clinician Portal. The intuitive design is implemented to directly connect with the userâ€™s needs. With that, many elements of the interface are contextual, showing what is needed and when, so that Patients can provide data with ease, and Care Teams can prioritise and focus attention where needed.
