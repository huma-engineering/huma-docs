title: Patient telemedicine
---

Direct communication from Care Teams to Patients is important to the healthcare journey. Insights and assessments are key to helping with Patient activation to inform lifestyle decisions. Huma’s Telemedicine feature allows Clinicians to book virtual appointments and attend video calls.

## How it works 

### Clinicians

From the Clinician Portal, Care Teams can select a Patient from the Patient List and click on the phone to view the Telemedicine screen. Here clicking “Schedule an appointment” will prompt the users to add a date and time to enter an appointment. When that time has reached the appointment the table will show a “Join Call” button and will start the call in the browser when clicked.

To enable calls, make sure your browser settings allow camera and microphone use.

### Patients

When an appointment is scheduled Patient will receive a notification to accept the date and time. When a Clinician joins the call it will ring the Patients phone just like any other incoming call.
