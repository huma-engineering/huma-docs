Once a Patient’s data has been viewed, Care Teams can make decisions and prioritise. Therefore, Huma allows Clinicians to add notes to a Patient to indicate their opinion and insight which will be made available to other members of a Care Team.

## How it works

### Clinicians

From the Clinician Portal and on Patient module details, notes can be added by clicking the “Add note / Resolve Flags” button in the top right. From the modal, Care Teams can review new entries in modules for that particular Patient and resolve any flags, and here notes can be entered.
