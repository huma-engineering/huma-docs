** Providing an Unbiased User Interface **

Huma aims to deliver a platform that is without prejudice, one that looks at the patient with impartiality to lead to care that is unbiased. This is what we believe healthcare should look like and strive to create a platform that is inclusive of all.

## How it works

In the Clinician Portal, all Profile attributes will be ordered alphabetically, to note in particular Gender, Biological Sex & Ethnicity. From this, anyone working with the platform is presented with an unopinionated view of all Patients.
