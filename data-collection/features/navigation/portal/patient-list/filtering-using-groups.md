** Find Patients Faster **

When it comes to Cliniciansâ€™ time, it is important to recognise that administration takes time away from care. Being able to find Patients and their data quickly makes the flow of decision-making and prioritisation one that does not require the time-consuming organisation of files and tables.

## How it works

In Huma, you can sort lists more intentionally and align them with the task at hand. Through this, the Clinician who is in a mode of prioritising tasks can use the app in line with the work being carried out. The sorting is as follows:

- Patients: 
    - All patients
    - My Patients
    - Off Boarded patients
    - Pending Patient Invitations 
- Staff:
    - All staff members
    - Pending Staff invitations
