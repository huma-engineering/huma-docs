** Helping Clinicians prioritise their Patients **

Huma in part is a tool for Clinicians to deliver healthcare from a digital-first perspective. What that aims to be is a place where Patients can work with professionals to lead longer and fuller lives by having the data necessary to make good health decisions.

## How it works

The Patient List is where decisions and prioritisation start, from taking the overview of Patients, and applying relevant filters and sorting to determine what care needs to be delivered first and to whom. From here Clinicians can action items and have confidence when connecting with Patients.
