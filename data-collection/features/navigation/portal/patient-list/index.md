** Helping Clinicians prioritise their Patients **

Huma in part is a tool for Clinicians to deliver healthcare from a digital-first perspective. What that aims to be is a place where Patients can work with professionals to lead longer and fuller lives by having the data necessary to make good health decisions.

## How it works

The Patient List is where decisions and prioritisation start, from taking the overview of Patients, and applying relevant filters and sorting to determine what care needs to be delivered first and to whom. From here Clinicians can action items and have confidence when connecting with Patients.

### Filtering using groups

In Huma, you can sort lists more intentionally and align them with the task at hand. Through this, the Clinician who is in a mode of prioritising tasks can use the app in line with the work being carried out. The sorting is as follows:

- Patients: 
    - All patients
    - My Patients
    - Off Boarded patients
    - Pending Patient Invitations 
- Staff:
    - All staff members
    - Pending Staff invitations

### Ordering Patients

In the Clinician Portal, all Profile attributes will be ordered alphabetically, to note in particular Gender, Biological Sex & Ethnicity. From this, anyone working with the platform is presented with an unopinionated view of all Patients.

### Search bar

The layout of the Patient list will give you the Patient sorted by Red-Amber-Green, putting the highest priority first. With that, the list of patients can be sorted by name, date of birth, and last updated. Also, suggested search terms from history will help Clinicians get back to where they left off.
