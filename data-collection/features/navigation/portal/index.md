** Giving Clinicians the right tool to deliver Health Care **

Huma provides an intuitive and powerful tool to help Clinicians prioritise and spotlight cases that need attention. Organising the data from Patients in a way that gives Care Teams a view of current readings and trends helps to improve the decision-making process.

## How it works

Patients record vitals through modules and complete questionnaires in the Huma App, which is then presented in the Clinician Portal with features to show severity, make comparisons, filter patients by vitals, add notes, and create thresholds for notification. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
