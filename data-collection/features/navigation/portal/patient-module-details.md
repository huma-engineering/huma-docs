** Patients as an overview **

When a member of a Care Team looks into a particular Patient, looking at all data available will build awareness of their current status of them. Therefore, Huma provides the Patient Module Details so Clinicians can quickly and easily digest that health data to help make decisions on the care to deliver.

## How it works

As Patients enter data and information into modules and questionnaires, the most recent results are displayed in a dashboard view with a variety of graphs and tables to best communicate the data being collected.

## Clinicians

From the Patient List in the Clinician Portal, selecting a Patient will display the Patient Module Details, with a grid of the activated modules with visual representations of the data, the last recorded result and an RAG indicator to indicate severity.

When you click on the module or questionnaire you will be taken to the individual results of the patientâ€™s entries.
