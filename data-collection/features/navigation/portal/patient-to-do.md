title: Patient to-do 
---

The health care journey for Patients involves providing what needs to be done and when. Therefore, Humaâ€™s To-do/Timeline feature is a place where Patients can understand their pending and upcoming key actions right from the home page.

## How it works

As Care Teams require data and feedback from Patients, Clinicians can create an action directly for a Patient or when certain conditions are met in the Clinician Portal.
