The Huma App is a configured experience by Administrators that gives Patients the ability to record their health data and self-observations, through Modules and Questionnaires. This gives Patients a way to share vitals with Care Teams and aid their own management of general health and specific conditions. 

## How it works

Patients record vitals through modules and complete questionnaires in the Huma App. Data is gathered from medical devices, such as a peak flow meter, and also can be automatically imported from consumer devices such as smartwatches. 

Actionable items from Care Teams can be provided from the To-do/Timeline, such as Appointment requests, to keep track of data collection from Patients and aid the health care journey.

Further reading and insights can be delivered through the app to educate Patients in particular areas to improve Patient activation so that they can take control of their longevity.
