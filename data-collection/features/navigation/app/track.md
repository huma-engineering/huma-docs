At the core of Huma’s offering is collecting Patient data and providing it to Care Teams for insights and aiding the health journey. The Track screen is where all modules and questionnaires are accessed by Patients to update and view the most recent record.

## How it works

When Patients log into the Huma App, the Track screen can be accessed from the bottom navigation bar. Every module and questionnaire available is presented as a card with the last recorded entry on display. Patients can click to view historical data and add new records.
