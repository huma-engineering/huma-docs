title: Self-managed Invitation System
---

** The Huma platform endeavours to be the tool needed for Care Teams to connect to their Patients that is simple, easy, and accessible to all. **

The first step of the journey of a Patient in Huma is to invite them to the platform so that they can be onboarded and therefore supply the data needed for their care. The Invitational System empowers Clinicians to manage the entire Patient journey and therefore is self-managed. Huma endeavours to deliver a product that makes this process intuitive so that the technology does not stand in the way of care.

## How it works

We make inviting a Patient to the platform straightforward, by being able to send them a unique email invitation, or by creating a general invitation link to be sent via any messaging platform they are most familiar with.

### General Link

The Huma portal provides a “Get link” button for alternate means of communication — giving Clinicians the ability to invite their Patients via methods other than email.

The URL generated is short enough to work with SMS or any popular messaging app without any issues for the invitee. This gives confidence to both Patients and Clinicians.
