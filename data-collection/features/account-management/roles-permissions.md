As a variety of people with different responsibilities access the platform through the Huma App, Clinician Portal, and Admin Portal, the data of the patient and institution has to be accessible with the sensitivity needed every particular instance. Therefore, Huma provides roles that are a collection of permissions that assign specific access for specific users. The combination of a role and the context of the action being taken then define the user’s ability to view or manage data.
