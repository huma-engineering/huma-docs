** Accessing the Platform **

The start of every journey in a platform is when an account is created. Huma envisions a sign-up process that is intuitive and accessible. One that enables Clinicians, Patients, and people involved in Clinical trials to be introduced into the platform without technical barriers. 

The welcoming nature of Huma is one that shows the approach and values that have gone into creating this platform and aspires to reflect this in the first instance of engaging with the platform and each and every time they come back.

## How it works

The Huma App is accessed via an invite system, in which Administrators invite their Care Team, and in turn Care Teams invite their Patients.

### Patients

New Patients can be invited via email by their Care Team, or be provided with an invitation link via a preferred means of communication. From there, they are taken to the App through the onboarding process, of which a password is requested to be created.

Included in the invite is a prompt to download the app from either the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

To log in, Patients can select “I already have an account” from the landing screen and follow the instructions on the screen to complete the login. 

### Clinicians

Once a member of a Care Team has been invited by an Administrator, they will receive an email with instructions to create their account.

From here the Clinician is taken to the sign-up page where they can enter their name and create a password. In addition, a Clinician will have to provide a phone number and will send a verification code to complete sign in. 

To sign in, go to the Clinician Portal (see table below) and just sign in with your email address and password, also you will be prompted for a verification code sent to the phone number added on sign up.

Currently, creating an account for the usage of the Admin Portal is via invitation from Huma directly.
