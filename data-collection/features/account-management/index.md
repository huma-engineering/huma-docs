Huma endeavours to deliver an intuitive experience that any User is in control of. With that, we put you in control of how you are represented in the product, how you access it, agreeing to what data can be collected and stored, and the process of leaving.

Consent is a value that Huma prioritises and creates a transparent and easy to access interface so no User is left in the dark.

## How it works

### Patients

From sign up, Patients can manage their account from the Huma App by pressing “Profile” on the bottom navigation. Here all users can change their preferences, manage their security, change personal information, and oversee their consent. 

### Clinicians

From sign up, Clinicians can click on their name in the top right corner and select “Profile”. On this screen Personal Details, Account Information, Preferred Units, and their Password can be managed.
