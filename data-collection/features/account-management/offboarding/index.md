Huma facilitates the healthcare and clinical trial journey for Patients and Participants, with that every stage needs to be managed and show responsibility for the data collected. Therefore, the end of the patient care journey is as important to Huma for its users as every other stage.

## How it works

### Clinicians

Given that a Clinician will not need to monitor a patient after a certain point, they can do so from the Patient details screen in the contextual menu, “Stop monitoring patient”. From here Clinicians are prompted to give a reason for the exit of the patient from a predetermined list of options as defined per regulatory requirements.

In the event that a Patient at any point does not consent to the informed consent form in onboarding then they will be off-boarded. Likewise, this will happen when a Participant in a study decides to withdraw from it.

Participants will be off-boarded when they fail the pre-screening questionnaire for the study they have been invited.

Particular invites require ID verification and in the event that this fails then this will also lead to off-boarding.

As a study comes to an end Huma will automatically take the Participants through off-boarding.

### Patients

When a Patient is off-boarded, they are informed at the end of monitoring with a list of possible reasons why this has happened. This will reassure them that this is a standard process and helps with providing context and confidence.

### Administrators

Configuration in the Admin Portal of deployment are the conditions that lead to the off-boarding for Patients and Participants mentioned above.

Patients not consenting, and Patients withdrawing from studies are determined by the configuration of the eConsent module.

A Participant meeting the requirements for a study is subject to the configuration of the Pre-screening module. 

Needing to verify the identity of Participants and setting as a requirement is configured using the IP verification module.

When a study is set up initially, the duration can be set and therefore all Participants are off-boarded when the study comes to an end.
