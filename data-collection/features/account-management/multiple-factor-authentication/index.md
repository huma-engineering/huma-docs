** How Huma keeps your data safe **

Huma takes the responsibility of everyone’s data seriously as we are aware of the sensitivity involved. With that, it is vital that the platform is accessible and secure at all points of entry, and we build our system to cope with all eventualities.

## How it works

Huma offers 2-factor authentication via password entry and entry of verification code sent to mobile for mobile and web to ensure that the person signing in is the person they say they are. This adds an extra layer of security and in the event of a compromised password then a malicious individual can be stopped before accessing any sensitive data.

### Patients

In the Huma App, this can be turned on from the Profile page under Account, and toggling “Two-step verification”. From there, they will be taken through steps to add a phone number and then sent a verification code via text message.

### Clinicians 

When signing up to the Clinician Portal, two-step verification via text message is on by default, therefore members of the care team invited to the platform they are prompted to add a phone number as part of signing up.

### Administrators

From the Admin Portal, Administrators can enforce multiple-factor authentication by going to the Deployment, selecting Deployment config and checking “multiple-factor authentication”.
