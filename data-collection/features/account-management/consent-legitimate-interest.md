title: Consent/Legitimate Interest
---

The Huma App provides the means to collect data from Patients and delivers it to Clinicians in an intuitive Portal that helps with prioritisation. Therefore, Patients will have to provide informed consent to Huma as part of agreeing to terms and conditions. 

The type of consent also varies based on the user type being a clinical trial participant or consumer health user. The consent also referred to as legitimate interest is a regulatory requirement which varies for different geographical regions.

## How it works

### Administrators

From the Admin Portal, the Helper agreement can be added from a Deployment, selecting Onboarding and clicking on “Consent” or “Legitimate Interest”.

### Patients

When going through onboarding, Patients will start at account activation, be taken through agree to terms and conditions and finally asked to consent with a signature and Huma will generate an electronic informed consent (eIC) PDF.
