** Shaping the visualisation of the data around the Patient. **

Just as healthcare is personalised and tailored to everyone, clinicians can tailor RAG thresholds to each patient.

## How it works

A Clinician can set what they think is appropriate as a threshold for a particular Patient. From the Patient profile screen, you can click “RAG Rating Configuration” and “Configure” on the records and set the values by changing the defaults already in place from onboarding.
