** Helping Care Teams prioritise their Patients with visualised data **

One of the goals of all Clinicians is to have the ability to prioritise Patients by looking at their vitals and current state. Allocating the attention needed to the patients needing the most care is important for the process of delivering healthcare effectively. 

Clinicians need to assess whether a particular vital data point is too high, too low, or acceptable. We can apply default thresholds for the cohort to create a red, amber, green indication for the health data entered by the Patient.

### How it works

From understanding the importance of giving the tools needed to deliver the best healthcare, all patients in the Huma platform provide the capability to see what is important with Flags and Red-Amber-Green (RAG). 

With this, a Clinician can see vital historical data at a glance, so that they can further assess a Patient and make better decisions for their healthcare. To add to that, the patient list can be sorted for flags to help with prioritisation and determine where urgency exists.

## Customised RAG

A Clinician can set what they think is appropriate as a threshold for a particular Patient. From the Patient profile screen, you can click “RAG Rating Configuration” and “Configure” on the records and set the values by changing the defaults already in place from onboarding.
