# Dashboard

#### Patient dashboard

This module shows the patient's individual modules and their most recent health records, including questionnaires that the patient has completed. When you click on the module or questionnaire you will be taken to the individual results of the patient's entries.

Physiological parameter ranges are colour-coded in yellow or red to assist in efficient prioritisation of patients. Any data entered that isn't highlighted in red or amber will not be flagged to you.

#### Patient profile

This module shows the patient's details and background information such as date of birth, gender, and email/phone number. You will have the ability to edit the information if needed and input Patient Identifier information, such as their NHS number. The clinician will also be able to filter the patients in the list by selecting 'My patients'.

#### Patient notes

Once you have reviewed a patient's new data submissions, you can enter a note and click 'Publish', which will act as confirmation of your review and will be saved with your initials, time and date stamps.

Once you have done this, the green icon appearing on the left side of the name of the patient on Patient List view will disappear, and the patient will no longer appear at the top of your list.

The patient will also receive a 'seen' message on their app to indicate that someone from the clinical team has seen and reviewed the data submissions.

#### Telemedicine

You can call the patient directly from the dashboard at any time. To do so, click the 'call patient' button at the top right corner of the portal, then click confirm on the pop-up window. To enable calls, make sure your browser settings allow camera and microphone use.

You're able to minimise the window of the call, so you can take notes and view the patient's data, while continuing the conversation.

Use the button showing a microphone to mute the call, and the button showing a camera to enable the video recording.

You can also review the history of all of the previous calls by clicking on the phone icon on the left hand side of the panel. Please note that the dashboard will not store unanswered attempts or other unsuccessful calls.
