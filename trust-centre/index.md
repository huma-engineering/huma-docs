The security of customer data, of our products, and our services is a top priority and a pillar in our values. All our developments are built with security at their core to ensure we offer a highly available and secure platform to our clients and partners while maintaining our commitment to relevant compliance standards. Our infrastructure is Secure by Design as a result of our [Defense in Depth](security/infrastructure-security) approach.

## Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is deployed in major cloud providers. We deploy multiple layers of security to protect our infrastructure. We are also cloud agnostic, so we are able to offer the highest level of flexibility to our customers in meeting regional and regulatory requirements.

## Privacy

## Encryption by default, at rest and in transit
We encrypt data in transit between our facilities and at rest, ensuring that it can only be accessed by authorized roles and services with audited access to the encryption keys. [Learn more](/trust-centre/security/#cryptography) about how we encrypt data at rest and how we encrypt data in transit.

## Compliance
We undergo independent verification of our security, and compliance controls to help you meet your regulatory and policy objectives. Find details on our full set of [compliance offerings](/trust-centre/compliance), like [ISO/IEC 27001](/trust-centre/compliance/iso27001), GDPR.
