## Encryption at rest and in transit
* Huma encrypts all personal data at rest by default, without the need for any further actions from the customer.
* This includes the data stored in Mongo DB as well as S3 buckets which in some cases are used as object storage for the app.
* By default, we use the managed encryption service offered by major providers (GCP, AWS, Azure , ...), however based on regional and customer requirements, we are able to manage the keys through Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).
