The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization with an international membership of 163 national standards bodies. The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards helps organizations keep their information assets secure.

ISO/IEC 27001 outlines and provides the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS), specifies a set of best practices, and details the security controls that can help manage information risks.

Huma services are certified as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant. The 27001 standard does not mandate specific information security controls, but the framework and checklist of controls it lays out allow to ensure a comprehensive and continually improving model for security management.
