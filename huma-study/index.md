Welcome to the Help Center for our clinical data platform, designed to streamline the setup and management of clinical studies.  
The platform supports clinical and research teams in building and managing studies, capturing participants' data, and monitoring study progress.

You can use the platform to:

- Create and configure new studies, including visits, forms, and survey packages.
- Set up forms with validation logic, option groups, and support for repeating data entries.
- Add participants, enter data, and monitor visit completion across study sites.
- Raise and resolve queries, perform source data verification (SDV), and track study status.
- Distribute surveys to participants and view responses in real time.
- Access dashboards for study progress, data verification, and outstanding queries.

Each study is built around structured visits and forms, allowing you to tailor the data collection process to your protocol.  
If needed, you can update forms using versioning tools to sync changes across participants while maintaining a full audit trail.

This documentation will guide you through every part of the platform, from creating your first study to managing participants and tracking results.
