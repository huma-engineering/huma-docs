# Designing a Form

Each form is composed of **fields**, which represent individual questions or data inputs. You can add fields by clicking **Add field**, then proceed with the following:

- Choose a question type:
    - Text (single or multiline)
    - Number / Dropdown / Checkbox
    - Date / Year / Slider
    - Radio button


- Enter:
    - **Question** – The label shown to the user
    - **Variable name** – Used in exports (can be auto-generated)
    - **Help text** – *(optional)* Guidance shown under the question
    - **Measurement unit** – *(optional)* e.g., cm, kg

Click **Save** to store your changes.

## Using Option Groups

For dropdowns or radio buttons, you can use **Option Groups** to define standardized response sets.

1. Under a dropdown or radio field, select **Option Group**.
2. Create or select a reusable group (e.g., “Country of Origin” with predefined values).
3. You can edit, delete, or add new items to any option group.

## Adding Logic and Validation

Each field can include:

- **Validations** – Rules that restrict values or trigger alerts  
  *(e.g., must be numeric, cannot be blank, conditional requirements)*

- **Dependencies** – Logic to show or hide fields based on another field’s response

- **Standardization and Export Settings** –  
  Exclude fields from export, apply formatting rules

These settings appear in the **right panel** under the field editing options.

## Viewing and Managing Visits and Forms

Once you’ve added multiple visits and forms, they appear in the **left-hand navigation** under the **Design** tab.

- Click a **visit name** to view its attached forms
- Click a **form** to edit its content or add new fields
- You can **rename or delete** any visit or form using the inline menu

All forms under each visit are grouped logically, and visits are listed in order.
