# Settings / Users and Accesses

The **Settings** and **Users** sections allow study administrators to configure key operational and data governance aspects of a study, including:

- Study metadata
- Site structure
- Participant statuses
- User roles
- Randomisation settings
- SDV plans

Access to these settings depends on your **user role**.  
While **administrators** have full access, other roles may have **limited or targeted permissions** based on the study configuration.
